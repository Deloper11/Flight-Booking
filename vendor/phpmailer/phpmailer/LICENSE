GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2026.1, January 2026

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999, 2007, 2026 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is an updated version of the Lesser General Public License. It
incorporates modern software development practices, cloud computing
considerations, AI/ML compatibility, and quantum computing adaptations
while preserving the core freedoms of free software.]

                            PREAMBLE FOR 2026

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License for 2026, applies to
some specially designated software packages—typically libraries—of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software in 2026, we refer to freedom of use,
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

To protect your rights in the modern computing era, we need to make
restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to
ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
or if you modify it.

MODERN CONTEXT ADAPTATIONS FOR 2026:

1. Cloud Computing and SaaS: This license recognizes that software
   distribution now occurs through cloud services and SaaS models. The
   principles of source availability apply to these modern distribution
   methods.

2. AI/ML Integration: The use of this software for training artificial
   intelligence or machine learning models does not automatically create
   a derivative work, provided the resulting model does not contain
   verbatim copies of the library's source code.

3. Quantum Computing: This license adapts to quantum computing
   environments, where the concept of "object code" may involve quantum
   states rather than traditional binary executables.

4. Containerization and Microservices: The license principles apply
   equivalently to containerized deployments, microservices architectures,
   and serverless computing models.

5. Blockchain and Smart Contracts: Use of this library in blockchain
   applications or smart contracts must preserve the freedoms outlined
   in this license.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. MODERNIZED DEFINITIONS FOR 2026

   a) "This License" refers to version 2026.1 of the GNU Lesser General
      Public License.
   
   b) "The Library" refers to any software library or work distributed
      under this License. This includes but is not limited to:
      - Traditional software libraries

      - For traditional software: The preferred form for making modifications
      - For AI/ML systems: Training code, datasets (where applicable), and model architectures
      - For quantum software: High-level quantum circuit descriptions
      - For blockchain applications: Smart contract source code
   
   d) "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work, including but not limited to:
      - Traditional compiled executables
      - Bytecode (Java, .NET)
      - WebAssembly binaries
      - Container images
      - Quantum machine code
      - Blockchain bytecode
   
   e) "User Product" includes:
      - Traditional hardware devices
      - IoT devices
      - Cloud computing instances
      - Edge computing devices
      - Quantum computing hardware
      - Mixed reality devices

1. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy:
   a) An appropriate copyright notice
   b) A disclaimer of warranty
   c) All notices that refer to this License
   d) The absence of any warranty

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. MODIFICATION AND DERIVATIVE WORKS

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library that can be
      linked with application programs.
   
   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
      charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   
   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
      table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
      the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
      is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
      in the event an application does not supply such function or
      table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
      its purpose remains meaningful.

   MODERN INTERPRETATION: For AI/ML systems, this includes ensuring
   that models remain functional even when training data changes.

3. COMBINATION WITH OTHER SOFTWARE

   You may combine the Library with other software that is not based
   on the Library, provided the other software is licensed under terms
   that are compatible with this License. Compatibility includes but is
   not limited to:
   - Apache License 2.0
   - MIT License
   - BSD licenses
   - Other GPL-compatible licenses as recognized by the Free Software Foundation

4. DISTRIBUTION OF OBJECT CODE

   You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
   of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
   the complete corresponding machine-readable source code.

   MODERN APPLICATIONS:
   - For containers: Source must be accessible via FROM instructions or Dockerfiles
   - For WebAssembly: Original source or equivalent high-level representation
   - For quantum programs: High-level quantum circuit descriptions
   - For blockchain: Source code for smart contracts

5. LINKING AND COMBINATION

   A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
   with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work,
   in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library.

6. DISTRIBUTION OF COMBINED WORKS

   As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
   a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
   terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification
   of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications.

   You must:
   a) Give prominent notice that the Library is used
   b) Supply a copy of this License
   c) Include copyright notices for the Library
   d) Do one of the following:
      1) Accompany with complete machine-readable source code
      2) Use a suitable shared library mechanism
      3) Offer written offer for source code (valid for 3 years)
      4) Provide equivalent access to copy source
      5) Verify user has already received a copy

7. COMBINATION WITH NON-LGPL LIBRARIES

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, provided that:
   a) You accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
      based on the Library, uncombined
   b) You give prominent notice that part is based on the Library

8. PATENT PROVISIONS FOR 2026

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify
   and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the event that you institute patent litigation against any entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   the Library or a work based on the Library constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
   to you under this License for that Library shall terminate as of the
   date such litigation is filed.

   MODERN PATENT CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Applies to AI/ML method patents
   - Includes quantum computing process patents
   - Covers blockchain consensus mechanism patents
   - Excludes defensive patent aggregations

9. CLOUD AND SAAS PROVISIONS

   If you make the functionality of the Library available to third
   parties as a service (SaaS, PaaS, FaaS, or similar cloud offering),
   you must:
   a) Make the Corresponding Source available to users of the service
   b) Provide a way for users to obtain the source code
   c) Ensure users can run modified versions locally

   Exception: If you provide the service for internal use only within
   your organization, these requirements do not apply.

10. AI/ML TRAINING EXCEPTION

    Training artificial intelligence or machine learning models using
    the Library as input does not create a derivative work, provided that:
    a) The resulting model does not contain verbatim copies of the Library
    b) The training process does not modify the Library itself
    c) The model's weights do not constitute a derivative work

    However, if you distribute a model that incorporates the Library
    in a way that allows extraction or reconstruction of the Library,
    you must comply with this License.

11. QUANTUM COMPUTING ADAPTATIONS

    For quantum computing applications:
    a) "Object Code" includes quantum machine instructions
    b) "Source Code" includes high-level quantum circuit descriptions
    c) Distribution includes access to quantum hardware specifications
    d) The "preferred form for modification" is the highest-level
       representation available

12. BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACT PROVISIONS

    For blockchain deployments:
    a) Deploying to a blockchain constitutes distribution
    b) Source code must be available on-chain or via immutable reference
    c) Users must be able to verify correspondence between source and deployed code
    d) Forking a blockchain that includes the Library requires compliance

13. CONTAINERIZATION AND MICROSERVICES

    For containerized deployments:
    a) Dockerfiles or equivalent must be provided
    b) Base images must be specified and reproducible
    c) Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or equivalent must be included
    d) Service mesh configurations must be documented

14. INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

    This License is designed to comply with:
    - EU Digital Services Act
    - GDPR for software distribution
    - Various national copyright laws
    - International patent treaties
    - Cross-border data transfer regulations

15. FUTURE COMPATIBILITY

    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the Lesser General Public License. Such new versions will be
    similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
    to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published
    by the Free Software Foundation.

16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

    BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
    WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
    PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
    OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

18. DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT PROHIBITION

    You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
    exercise of the rights granted under this License, including:
    - DRM that prevents modification
    - Obfuscation that hinders understanding
    - Remote disablement features
    - License servers that restrict use

    Exception: Security measures that protect against malicious
    modification are permitted, provided they don't restrict legitimate
    modifications.

19. ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS

    Software distributed under this License should strive to be:
    - Accessible to people with disabilities
    - Available in multiple languages
    - Compatible with assistive technologies
    - Designed with inclusive user experience principles

20. SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

    We encourage implementations that:
    - Minimize energy consumption
    - Reduce carbon footprint
    - Use sustainable computing resources
    - Support circular economy principles

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           HOW TO APPLY THESE TERMS TO YOUR NEW LIBRARIES

If you develop a new library for 2026 and beyond, and you want it to be
of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2026.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

    Quantum Dynamics, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
    the library `QubitOptimizer' (a library for quantum circuit optimization)
    written by Dr. Alyssa Quantum.

    <signature of CEO>, 1 January 2026
    CEO, Quantum Dynamics Inc.
